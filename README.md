Warning: This is a work in progress!

In this project, we simulate a set of Stellar Binaries in isolation using [COMPAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10352), with the intention of studying the connection of Compact Object (CO) binary mergers to their host galaxy properties.

The range of initial Star Forming Mass simulated is [8.69605246e+03, 9.78529039e+04, 1.02292006e+06, 1.02229903e+07] $M_\odot$.

The range of metallicities is [0.0001, 0.00018847, 0.0003552, 0.00066943, 0.00126166, 0.00237782, 0.0044814, 0.00844598, 0.01591789, 0.03] $Z_{abs}$.

The notebook containing the results of the simulations is [bh_properties.ipynb](../main/bh_properties.ipynb).
